# Hey! I'm Filing Here

In this lab, I successfully implemented the following, a 1 MiB ext2 file system with 2 directories, 1 symbolic link, and 1 regular file

## Building

To Build the program run:
```shell
make
```

## Running

```shell
./ext2-create 
To mount, run: 
mkdir mnt sudo mount -o loop cs111-base.img mnt
```


## Cleaning up

TODO
